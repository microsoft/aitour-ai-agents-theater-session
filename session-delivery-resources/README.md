## How To Deliver This Session

Welcome!! You are here because you want to be able to _deliver_ this session at a future event or meetup. You may be an experienced presenter, or a first-time speaker. Our goal is to help make your session preparation and delivery as painless as possible, and help our audiences engage effectively with you and the content.

### Resources

### Setup

1. You will reuse resources from [WRK552](https://aka.ms/aitour/wrk552)
1. You will need a personal GitHub account.
1. You will need an active Azure subscription.
1. Setup an hour before - launch Codespaces and provision Azure.
1. Do a quick walkthrough - verify all demos are working.

### Delivery

This is a 15-minute session so here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Plan Your Time.** The clock moves fast so don't waste a second.
1. **Plan Your Messages.** Aim for 2-3 demos max, each with 1 takeaway.
1. **Plan for the Worst.** Record demos as a backup if tech issues occur.
1. **Show that last slide!.** Make it memorable so they want to capture it.

Here is a recommended flow - but feel free to adapt to your pace and style.

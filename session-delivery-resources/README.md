### Delivery

This is a 15-minute session so here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Plan Your Time.** The clock moves fast so don't waste a second.
1. **Plan Your Messages.** Aim for 2-3 demos max, each with 1 takeaway.
1. **Plan for the Worst.** Record demos as a backup if tech issues occur.
1. **Show that last slide!.** Make it memorable so they want to capture it.

Here is a recommended flow - but feel free to adapt to your pace and style.

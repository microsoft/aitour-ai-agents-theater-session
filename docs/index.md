## 2. Setup: Theater Session Labs

The theater session is meant to be demo-driven. You will be using the resources from the [WRK552](https://aka.ms/aitour/wrk552) repo for the interactive segments. 

1. You must ALSO have an Azure subscription to complete this step.
1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop/) to your personal profile.
1. Follow the [Setup: Self-Guided Learners](https://microsoft.github.io/build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop/introduction-self-guided/) instructions on your fork.
1. The [Deploy the Azure Resources](https://microsoft.github.io/build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop/introduction-self-guided/#deploy-the-azure-resources) step takes time - plan ahead!
1. Run through the workshop once to verify everything is working for the various Lab modules.

!!! tip "Things to keep in mind"

    1. GitHub Codespaces takes a few minutes to launch. _Launch both sessions ahead of time_.
    1. Lab walkthrough takes 30 minutes post launch. _Do setup at least an hour before theater session_.
    1. Set GitHub Codespaces idle time to more than 30 minutes. _This prevents need for relaunch while you wait_.

_You are now ready to walk through the training!_.

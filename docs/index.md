## 1. Setup Environment

To run the code samples or preview the instructions in a browser, you will need to setup your development environment. For convenience, this repo is instrumented with a `devcontainer.json` making it easy to just launch this in GitHub Codespaces for a prebuilt environment.

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/aitour-ai-agents-theater-session) to your personal profile.
1. Open the fork in a browser - then click the **Code** button
1. Navigate to the **Codespaces** tab - then click "+" to start a new codespace.
1. Wait till ready - you will see a **Visual Studio Code** editor with termninal.

_You are now ready to explore!_.

## 2. Preview The Docs

The demos are documented in the form of a tutorial that can be useful to both learners (post-talk exploration) and instructors (pre-talk preparation). To view these:

1. Make sure you launched GitHub Codespaces (see above)
1. Open the VS Code terminal when ready and type `mkdocs serve`
1. You will get the option to preview in browser or in local editor
1. Select browser - a new tab will open with a web preview of the docs site.

You can now use this site to navigate the content. Note that it has a built-in **search** feature and **dark mode** options for convenience.

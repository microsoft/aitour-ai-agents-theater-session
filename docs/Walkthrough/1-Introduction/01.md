# 1.1 Preparing The Talk

## 1. Customize Presentation
You will find a link to a Powerpoint deck in the speaker resources. Take a minute to download that and make a copy for yourself. This is the title slide.

- Customize the profile image to your own.
- Update the speaker name and affiliation.
- Encourage learners to visit repo (star or fork)

## 2. Initialize Workshop Demo

You should have [completed setup](./../../index.md#2-setup-theater-session-labs) of the workshop that is the basis for the demos we will use in this session - and done a preliminary walkthrough to make sure demos work.

- Open a browser tab to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) - navigate to the AI project.
- Open a browser tab to [WRK552 Codespaces](https://aka.ms/aitour/WRK552) - you launched this earlier.
- Uncommment all tools **except Bing** in the `main.py` file.
- Uncomment **only the first instruction** in the `main.py` file.

You should now be in a position to run the first three demos from the GitHub Codespaces session (client-side) by just uncommenting instructions one at a time. We will handle the fourth demo differently since it will also require interactions at the Azure AI Foundry portal.

!!! tip "PRE-RECORD DEMO FOR BACKUP"

    There may be network issues or platform changes that may hamper your ability to demo live. Take a minute during your earlier walkthrough to record short videos that you can _speak to_ if live demos fail.

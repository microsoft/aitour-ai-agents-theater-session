# 2.2 Create An Agent (3 min)

!!! quote "DEMO: Azure AI Foundry - 1 min"

    Let's build it! Hereâ€™s my Azure AI Service project:

    - I have a deployed model
    - I have a project resource WITH A CONNECTION STRING
    - I have low-code options to create agents, deploy models and more
    
!!! quote "DEMO: Visual Studio Code - 2 min"

    - I can also use a code-first approach with Python SDK
    - I created an AI project client with that connection string
    - I created a standard agent with a name, model, tools and instructions defined
    - Now all I have to do is add TOOLS and update INSTRUCTIONS for each scenario.

        2. Visualization and Code Interpretation

        - Test and display visualization code using the code interpreter, retrying if errors occur.
        - Always use charts or graphs to illustrate trends when requested.
        - Always create visualizations as `.png` files.
        - Always include the file_path_annotation.
        - Adapt visualizations (e.g., labels) to the user's language preferences.
        - When asked to download data, default to a `.csv` format file and use the most recent data.
        ```

    - EXPLAIN: 
        - You just saw the Code Interpreter tool in action
        - It created chart and saved it to a file! (I don't have to know how to code this!)
